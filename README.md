# Pandemic Impact Research and Visualization

## Overview
The current pandemic has significantly impacted our lives, influencing both our health and daily routines. Our team aims to explore and visualize how the pandemic evolved globally, the effect of vaccinations, and the challenges faced by victims. This project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact through data analysis and visualization.

## Project Goals
- **Explore the Data**: Analyze data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccinations.
- **Visualize the Impact**: Create graphs and charts to showcase the growth and decline of the pandemic.
- **Understand the Effects**: Study the mental and physical health impacts of the pandemic on individuals.
- **Raise Awareness**: Highlight the importance of vaccinations in controlling and eradicating the pandemic.

## Categories
To achieve a thorough understanding of the pandemic's impact, we have divided our research into four main categories:

### 1. Covid Victims
This category focuses on individuals affected by COVID-19 globally, including those who succumbed to the disease. We analyze data on infection rates, mortality rates, and the spread of the virus across different regions.

### 2. Hospitals
This category examines the health sector's response to the pandemic. We analyze data on hospital admissions, the increase in hospital capacities, and resource management during the pandemic.

### 3. Health
This category investigates the post-pandemic effects on people's mental and physical health. We explore how the pandemic-induced isolation and fear contributed to increased mental stress and physical ailments. The National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Census Bureau developed a new data system to monitor mental health during this time.

### 4. Vaccination
This category highlights the role of vaccinations in mitigating the pandemic. We showcase the number of people vaccinated with different doses (dose 1, dose 2, booster shot) across various regions, with a focus on the United States. We aim to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination in controlling and eradicating the epidemic.
